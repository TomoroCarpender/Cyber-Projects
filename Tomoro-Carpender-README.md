Cloud Network

This is a repository of Lunix Scripts and Ansible Scripts which I created in my CyberSecurity Class. 

The scripts were created for the most part to configure the cloud servers and the docker container which I setup. 

For this setup I had 4 servers running vulnerable DVWA containers along with a Jump-Box and a server which was running an ELK Stack container.
